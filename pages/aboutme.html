    <div class="about-me-text">
        <p>My name is Monika. I’m a visual artist from Poland. Painting, graphics arts, design and music are my fields of interest. My work is based on senses and emotion. That is why art I create tends to focus around abstraction, expressionism and colors. I try to transfer energy through pieces of work I make.</p>
        <p>Besides painting I also play on clarinet. Music and painting connects and inspire each other. I love improvisation in music. I’m open to collaborate with musicians not only in playing but also in scenography and event theme design.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Academy of Fine Arts in Katowice on Faculty of Graphic Arts. My works were part of many group and some individual exhibitions.</p>
